Acts As Permalink
===============

Manages permalink field on an ActiveRecord model to be used in place of the id field in Rails.


Usage
=====

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_permalink
end

That's about it. 
The plugin expects string fields to be used to save the permalink on the model and to use as a source for the permalink. It defaults to use the fields named "title" and "permalink" which can be overridden by options:

:from        =>  :title       # Name of the active record column or function used to generate the permalink
:to          =>  :permalink   # Name of the column where the permalink will be stored
:max_length  =>  60           # Maximum number of characters the permalink will be
